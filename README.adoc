= LRA Spring Boot and Axon Quickstarts

This repository extends https://github.com/jbosstm/quickstart/tree/master/rts/lra[Narayana LRA quickstart] about Spring Boot and Axon examples.
Examples can replace the original services in the Narayana quickstart so they can be used with the original quickstart scenario.
